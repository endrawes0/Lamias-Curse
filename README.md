## Executive Summary
### Game Overview
The player moves through a series of increasingly challenging "dungeons" - each of which being an empty Scrabble board. The player collects, earns and buys more powerful tiles and gameplay modifiers that allow them to pass through more challenging levels and increasingly difficult goals. After some number of levels the player encounters regular boss-battles that modify some aspect of the gameplay, such as: decreasing the number of tiles in hand, reducing the size of the board, or removing score-modifiers (Double Word/Triple Letter/etc).

### Genre
Puzzle - Like Scrabble/Crossword
Deck-building - Collecting tiles, consumables, game play modifiers
Roguelike - "Hardcore" gameplay, quick game loops, grid-based
Dungeon Crawler - Figurative/Literal dungeons/caves as a setting. Boss-battles with unique challenges/abilities/rewards.
